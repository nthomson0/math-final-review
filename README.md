# 2. Binomial Distrobution - One question

- Unit 7 notes last two pages

- Probability formula ?
- E[] & V[] (Expected value and variance)

# 3. Sampling Distrobution - One question

- Unit 8 Practice # 1, 2, 3

- Recognize: sample proportion (p-hat) vs sample mean (x-bar)
- Recognize normal distrobution with: np >= 5, nq >= 5, n >= 30

# 4. Hypothesis Testing - Four questions

- Unit 9: HT for mu or P

- Unit 10: HT for mu1-mu2 or p1-p2

- Unit 11: ANOVA --> H0 = mu1-mu2-mu3, H1 = otherwise
- You will be given a partially completed ANOVA table on paper, just complete the last numbers.

- Unit 12: Independence Test (CHI) --> Factor 1 & Factor 2 are independent vs. ....
